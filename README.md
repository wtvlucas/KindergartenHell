# KindegartenHell

A 2D puzzle game made in the Godot Engine. You play as a teacher tasked with guiding a group of unpredictable children into the school. Each time you move, they react â€” but each child behaves differently, turning every level into a unique logic challenge. This prototype was created for a presentation and includes HTML5 export with gamepad support, making it playable on Android devices. Note: this is an earlier version of the game.
